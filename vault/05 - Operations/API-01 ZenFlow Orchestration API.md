# API-01 ZenFlow Orchestration API

> [!info] Source design, not a deployed integration
> The API Matrix labels all 20 custom APIs as work to build. This note preserves a planning contract and does not assert that an endpoint exists.

## Interface and data contract
Task dispatch accepts agent_id, task, division and aegis_level at /dispatch. JWT validation and the current hold registry precede routing to a division n8n webhook. Response carries trace_id.

## Proposed dependencies
Supabase; FastAPI; Railway; n8n. Availability, authorization and current deployment require separate evidence.

## Current gates and interpretation
Use current [[Agent Tier Registry]] and [[Director Codenames]], not historical director aliases.

## Acceptance record before activation
Record the versioned schema, authenticated principal, division scope, source freshness, error behavior and retention policy. Attach test evidence for invalid input and unauthorized requests, a deployment reference and the approving decision. Leave absent owners, dates, prices and metrics unfilled.
