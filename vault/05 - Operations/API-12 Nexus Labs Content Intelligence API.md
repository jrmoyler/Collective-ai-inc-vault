# API-12 Nexus Labs Content Intelligence API

> [!info] Source design, not a deployed integration
> The API Matrix labels all 20 custom APIs as work to build. This note preserves a planning contract and does not assert that an endpoint exists.

## Interface and data contract
Daily platform ingestion feeds GET /content/performance. Records include platform, post_id, reach, engagement_rate, sentiment_score and virality_index for a reporting period.

## Proposed dependencies
Supabase; n8n; FastAPI; proposed YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and X APIs. Availability, authorization and current deployment require separate evidence.

## Current gates and interpretation
No live social connection or measured virality is verified by the matrix. Define metric formulas and source timestamps before comparing platforms.

## Acceptance record before activation
Record the versioned schema, authenticated principal, division scope, source freshness, error behavior and retention policy. Attach test evidence for invalid input and unauthorized requests, a deployment reference and the approving decision. Leave absent owners, dates, prices and metrics unfilled.
