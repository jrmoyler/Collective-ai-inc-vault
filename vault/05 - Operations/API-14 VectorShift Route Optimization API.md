# API-14 VectorShift Route Optimization API

> [!info] Source design, not a deployed integration
> The API Matrix labels all 20 custom APIs as work to build. This note preserves a planning contract and does not assert that an endpoint exists.

## Interface and data contract
POST /routes/optimize accepts origin, destinations, vehicle_type and time_window. Output includes route_sequence, eta, fuel_estimate and risk_flags.

## Proposed dependencies
Supabase; FastAPI; proposed HERE and OpenWeather APIs. Availability, authorization and current deployment require separate evidence.

## Current gates and interpretation
VectorShift is chartered. Route advice is distinct from vehicle execution; geofences and no-fly constraints need verified inputs and physical autonomy approval.

## Acceptance record before activation
Record the versioned schema, authenticated principal, division scope, source freshness, error behavior and retention policy. Attach test evidence for invalid input and unauthorized requests, a deployment reference and the approving decision. Leave absent owners, dates, prices and metrics unfilled.
