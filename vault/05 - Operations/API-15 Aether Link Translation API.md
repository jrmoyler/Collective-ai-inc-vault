# API-15 Aether Link Translation API

> [!info] Source design, not a deployed integration
> The API Matrix labels all 20 custom APIs as work to build. This note preserves a planning contract and does not assert that an endpoint exists.

## Interface and data contract
POST /translate takes text, source_lang, target_lang and context_domain. Output includes translation, cultural_notes, formality_score and back_translation_confidence; source proposes queued speech output.

## Proposed dependencies
Supabase; FastAPI; proposed DeepL or NLLB; ElevenLabs. Availability, authorization and current deployment require separate evidence.

## Current gates and interpretation
Aether Link is chartered. Confidence fields require defined evaluation and must not conceal uncertainty in high-stakes communications.

## Acceptance record before activation
Record the versioned schema, authenticated principal, division scope, source freshness, error behavior and retention policy. Attach test evidence for invalid input and unauthorized requests, a deployment reference and the approving decision. Leave absent owners, dates, prices and metrics unfilled.
