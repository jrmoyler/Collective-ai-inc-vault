# API-20 Eon Core Longevity Intelligence API

> [!info] Source design, not a deployed integration
> The API Matrix labels all 20 custom APIs as work to build. This note preserves a planning contract and does not assert that an endpoint exists.

## Interface and data contract
POST /longevity/assess takes chronological_age, biomarkers and lifestyle. Output includes biological_age, delta, longevity_score, protocol_recommendations and clinical_review_required.

## Proposed dependencies
Supabase; FastAPI; Railway; proposed Vital Helix shared pipeline. Availability, authorization and current deployment require separate evidence.

## Current gates and interpretation
Eon Core is chartered. Biological age estimates and intervention effects need clinical validation; no medical efficacy or live health pipeline is established.

## Acceptance record before activation
Record the versioned schema, authenticated principal, division scope, source freshness, error behavior and retention policy. Attach test evidence for invalid input and unauthorized requests, a deployment reference and the approving decision. Leave absent owners, dates, prices and metrics unfilled.
